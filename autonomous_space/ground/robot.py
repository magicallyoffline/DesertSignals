NASA Space Apps 2025 â€“ Ground Sensor Simulation

Simulated ground-based sensors that monitor environmental conditions:
 - Soil moisture
 - Air temperature
 - Humidity

These sensors provide the local verification layer for satellite data,
forming the 'bottom-up' half of the autonomous-space system.

All communications are routed securely through the core router.
