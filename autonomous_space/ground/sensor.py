NASA Space Apps 2025 â€“ Ground Robotics Simulation
-------------------------------------------------
Simulated autonomous ground robot node that:
 - Collects environmental readings from sensors.
 - Analyzes field conditions.
 - Relays verified results through secure comms.

This simulates how field robots (agricultural or environmental)
support satellite and drone networks with ground truth.
