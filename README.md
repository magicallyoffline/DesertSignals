# Desert Signals is web-based tool that visualizes real-time air quality and weather data using NASA and open-source APIs.

- Combine NASA TEMPO, OpenAQ, and Open-Meteo data sources

- Show near-real-time pollutant concentrations (NOâ‚‚, PMâ‚‚.â‚…, Oâ‚ƒ, CHâ‚‚O, Aerosols, CO)

- Connect these to their environmental causes and public health impacts

- Help users explore the planet interactively and understand how pollution affects life.

- This project is in development â€” future versions will include richer NASA overlays, historical trends, and automated health alerts. This challenge only has one team member.

# Raspberry Pi Spectrometer â€” NASA Hackathon Build

This Spectrometer implements a compact, low-cost optical spectrometer for environmental monitoring.
It uses a diffraction grating (1000 lines/mm) and a 0.1 mm slit to disperse light onto a Pi or USB camera.
Python software performs real-time wavelength calibration, normalization, and streaming of spectra and sensor data. It is a blueprint due to other api's being unavailable. The decision to make our own was based on data science.

Features:

- Polynomial wavelength calibration using reference lamp (Hg/Ne/CFL)

- Dark and white frame correction for accurate relative intensity

- Spectral-response compensation â†’ relative radiance output

- Optional near-UV capture for NOâ‚‚ / HCHO absorption features

- GPS-tagged data packets for satellite co-location (TEMPO, TROPOMI)

- Optional PMâ‚‚.â‚…, NOâ‚‚, HCHO sensors for ground truth

- Flask + Plotly dashboard for live visualization

- Data Flow

- Light enters slit â†’ dispersed by grating â†’ recorded by camera.

- Python extracts and calibrates the spectrum.

- Device metadata (GPS, sensors, timestamp) attached.

- JSON payload sent to server via HTTP POST.

- Dashboard displays live spectra and pollutant readings.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 4 (or 3B+)

-Pi Camera Module or USB Webcam (visible + near-UV sensitive)

- Diffraction grating film 1000 lines/mm

- Precision slit 0.1 mm

- Optional sensors: PMS5003 (PMâ‚‚.â‚…), NOâ‚‚ electrochemical, HCHO sensor, GPS HAT

- Matte black enclosure (light-tight)

- Software Stack

- Python 3 / OpenCV / NumPy / SciPy / Flask / Plotly 

- Optional: requests (for HTTP), gpsd-py3 (for GPS)

- Calibration Procedure

- Capture dark frame (cover slit).

- Capture white frame (uniform light).

- Capture reference lamp spectrum and assign known wavelengths.

- Save polynomial coefficients to calibration.json.

- Output

- wavelength_nm[] â€” Calibrated wavelength axis

- intensity[] â€” Normalized radiance spectrum

- peaks_nm[] â€” Detected emission lines

- pps.lat/lon, sensor readings, timestamp

## Dashboard

Run server_dashboard.py to start a local Flask server.
