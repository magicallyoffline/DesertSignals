# Desert Signals is web-based tool that visualizes real-time air quality and weather data using NASA and open-source APIs.

- Combine NASA TEMPO, OpenAQ, and Open-Meteo data sources

- Show near-real-time pollutant concentrations (NO₂, PM₂.₅, O₃, CH₂O, Aerosols, CO)

- Connect these to their environmental causes and public health impacts

- Help users explore the planet interactively and understand how pollution affects life.

- This project is in development — future versions will include richer NASA overlays, historical trends, and automated health alerts. This challenge only has one team member.
